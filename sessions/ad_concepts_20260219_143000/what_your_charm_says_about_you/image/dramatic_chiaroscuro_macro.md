## Brand Visual Direction
This variation uses the most contrast-forward approach in the set — a tightly controlled single light source that sculpts the charm details in high relief against deep, warm shadow. The brand's celestial and symbolic qualities are amplified here: the anchor, moon, and star emerge from darkness like meaningful objects revealed under a focused beam. The warmth is preserved entirely in the light and metal tones; the shadow falls into deep amber-brown rather than cool black, keeping the emotional register empowering rather than austere.

## Generation Prompt
> An extreme close-up macro photograph of three Alex and Ani gold charm bangles stacked on a woman's wrist, medium-warm skin tone, lit with a single narrow directional light source from the upper-left at roughly 45 degrees — creating dramatic chiaroscuro across the surface of each charm. The anchor charm, crescent moon phase charm, and shooting star charm are each rendered in sharp three-dimensional relief: warm highlights carving the raised surfaces of the charms, deep amber-brown shadows pooling in the recesses and engraved details. The skin of the wrist is partially visible beneath the bangles, glowing warm in the sidelight. Background falls into a rich, warm deep brown-amber darkness — not black, not grey, but the color of aged amber or dark honey. The depth of field is extremely shallow, with the center bangle's charm in sharpest focus and the upper and lower bangles falling into gentle blur. The photograph is bold, symbolic, and artistically lit — the mood of a portrait of an object with meaning. Shot at macro equivalent, the charms fill at least 60% of the frame. Color-graded with high contrast, warm amber highlights, and deep honey-brown shadows — no cool tones anywhere in the image.

## Composition & Layout
- **Composition:** Near-centered vertical stack — the three bangles fill the frame vertically; the moon phase charm is centered and sharpest
- **Perspective:** Eye-level to the wrist, extremely close — macro distance, as if examining the charms under reverent attention
- **Framing:** Tight on the bangle stack; wrist skin visible at edges; no arm beyond the immediate bangle area; background pure warm darkness
- **Focal point:** The moon phase charm at center — the most visually complex of the three, pulling focus with its engraved detail

## Subject & Arrangement
- **Primary subject:** Three gold Alex and Ani charm bangles stacked on a wrist — anchor, moon phase, shooting star
- **Positioning:** Vertical stack centered in frame; charms rotated to face directly at camera
- **Props/styling:** No props — the bangles and wrist skin are the entirety of the visible subject
- **Scale:** Extreme close-up / macro — bangles fill the frame; individual charm engravings are legible

## Lighting
- **Key light:** Single narrow light source — snoot or grid spot — from upper-left at 45 degrees; warm tungsten quality (3200–3500K)
- **Fill:** None — deliberate; shadow side falls to deep amber-brown with no fill bounce
- **Color temperature:** 3200–3500K (warm tungsten / candle-adjacent); creates warm gold on metal, warm amber on shadow
- **Mood:** Dramatic, reverent, symbolic — the light of a spotlight on something that matters

## Color Palette & Grading
- **Dominant colors:** Deep amber-brown (shadow), burnished warm gold (#ab8c52) (highlights), rich honey (skin in light)
- **Accent colors:** Near-black amber in deepest shadow recesses; soft white-gold specular on charm crown
- **Grade:** High contrast with warm tonal range throughout — no cool shadows; highlights pulled amber-gold; blacks replaced with deep warm brown; overall luminosity kept intimate

## Background & Environment
- **Setting:** Abstract — pure warm darkness; no environmental context, no surface visible
- **Surface/backdrop:** Implied warm dark background — dark amber, aged wood tone, or deep honey — rendered as smooth, featureless dark ground
- **Depth of field:** Extremely shallow — f/1.4 macro equivalent; center bangle sharp, upper and lower in gentle blur; background fully dissolved

## Typography Direction
- **Text placement:** Text kept minimal in this variation — a single charm name label per charm in small warm gold serif, placed beside each bangle along the left margin; CTA at the very bottom in cream on a thin warm-dark bar
- **Font style:** Fine serif — elegantly sized, not dominant; the image carries the weight
- **Color:** Warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm name labels; cream white for CTA; both against the dark ground

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani anchor charm bangle, moon phase bangle, shooting star bangle (product detail references — high-res macro preferred)
- Brand swatch: warm gold #ab8c52, deep amber shadow tone

## Style References
- Fine watchmaking macro photography — IWC, Patek Philippe campaign close-ups
- Irving Penn's object portraiture — objects lit with single source, sculptural shadow
- Art jewelry editorial macro work — charm and engraving detail in low-key light
- Cinematic product photography: dark-field, single-source, warm tungsten

## Negative Prompts
- No white, grey, or cool-toned backgrounds — warm dark amber only
- No fill light — preserve the dramatic shadow
- No cool-toned or silver metal — all gold must be warm brass-gold
- No more than 3 bangles in frame
- No additional props, surfaces, or environmental elements visible
- Avoid AI-generated hand artifacts — natural skin texture at macro scale
- No soft or flat lighting — the contrast is essential to this variation
- No spiritual clichés: crystals, candles, smoke

## Post-Production Notes
- High-contrast warm grade: deepen shadows to warm amber-brown, not cold black; push highlights toward gold
- Dodge charm highlight faces selectively to amplify the three-dimensional relief of each charm
- Burn shadow recesses in charm engravings for legibility and drama
- Charm name labels in warm gold serif — placed in left margin beside each bangle
- Suppress any cool channel completely — the image should contain no blue or grey
- Produce three skin tone variants for A/B testing (Fitzpatrick II, III–IV, V)
- Micro-sharpening on charm surfaces for maximum engraving detail at mobile display resolution
- Consider a very subtle warm lens flare at the key light's specular point — optional, test A/B
