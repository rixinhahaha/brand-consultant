# What Your Charm Says About You — Editorial Lifestyle On Model
**Format:** Static | **Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 (portrait)
**Ad Copy:** "Every charm has a meaning. This one is yours." / "The anchor. The moon. The star. Each Alex and Ani charm carries researched symbolism — choose the one that speaks to who you are right now."
**CTA:** Find Your Charm

## Brand Visual Direction
This variation pulls back to include the model at a medium-portrait scale — wrist and bangles remain the hero, but the image now carries human context: a woman at rest, unposed, present. The visual language borrows from editorial fashion portraiture — the warmth of a late-afternoon interior, soft ambient light, and a composition that feels candid rather than constructed. The brand's empowering, nurturing tone is expressed through the quiet confidence of the subject's posture rather than product isolation alone.

## Generation Prompt
> A medium-portrait editorial photograph of a woman, medium-warm skin tone, seated casually at a wooden table or near a warm-lit interior window. The frame captures her from approximately mid-torso to just above the wrist, with her arms resting naturally on the surface in front of her — the wrist wearing three stacked gold Alex and Ani charm bangles is positioned in the lower-center of the frame, close enough that the anchor, moon phase, and shooting star charms are individually legible. Her clothing is simple and warm-toned — a soft linen blouse or loose knit in ivory or warm sand — not the focus, but grounding. The light is soft and directional, coming from a large window at camera-left, creating a gentle luminous quality on skin and catching the gold metal with a warm specular highlight. The background is a softly blurred warm interior — a suggestion of cream walls, warm wood tones, or draped fabric — rendered as a gentle bokeh wash. The composition is relaxed and editorial in character: not a campaign pose, but a moment of quiet. Color palette is honey, warm sand, soft ivory, and burnished gold. Shot at approximately 50–85mm equivalent focal length, shallow depth of field keeping the bangles and lower forearm sharpest. Color-graded with warm amber light, cream-lifted shadows, no cool tones.

## Composition & Layout
- **Composition:** Off-center vertical — model's torso slightly left, wrist and bangles centered or slightly right; asymmetric and relaxed
- **Perspective:** Eye-level, slightly above — approximately 15–20 degrees above horizontal, natural seated view
- **Framing:** Mid-torso to wrist visible; face out of frame or at soft upper edge; intimate but not clinical
- **Focal point:** The stacked bangles — anchor charm sharpest, directing eye downward through frame

## Subject & Arrangement
- **Primary subject:** Woman's forearm and wrist wearing three gold charm bangles; her torso provides human grounding
- **Positioning:** Arms at rest on surface in front of her; natural, relaxed body language
- **Props/styling:** Simple warm-toned linen or knit top; no jewelry other than the three bangles; wooden table surface or soft textile
- **Scale:** Medium — bangles clearly legible but model's body present for human warmth

## Lighting
- **Key light:** Large soft window light from camera-left, diffused through sheer curtain or cloud cover
- **Fill:** Warm ambient bounce from table surface and interior walls — keeps shadows open and honey-toned
- **Color temperature:** 4600–5000K (warm interior window)
- **Mood:** Quiet, luminous, personal — the light of a thoughtful Sunday afternoon

## Color Palette & Grading
- **Dominant colors:** Warm sand (clothing), honey gold (#ab8c52) (bangles), soft peach-amber (skin)
- **Accent colors:** Warm ivory (background wash), burnished brass (charm details)
- **Grade:** Warm amber highlights; cream-lifted shadows; gentle desaturation of cool channel; skin tones rendered rich and warm without oversaturation

## Background & Environment
- **Setting:** Warm interior — domestic or café-like, indistinct and blurred
- **Surface/backdrop:** Wooden table surface, warm-toned; background walls in cream or warm linen tone, fully blurred
- **Depth of field:** Shallow — f/1.8–2.0 equivalent; bangles sharpest, background and upper torso softly blurred

## Typography Direction
- **Text placement:** Upper-left or upper-right corner — headline above the model's implied eyeline; charm names as small labels floating near each bangle; CTA at bottom with subtle warm gradient backing
- **Font style:** Refined editorial serif for headline; lightweight sans-serif for body and CTA
- **Color:** Warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm labels; cream or soft white for headline text to contrast against warm mid-tone background

## Negative Prompts
- No white or grey backgrounds — warm interior tones only
- No posed or catalog-style model positioning — must feel candid and unstudied
- No cool-toned or silver jewelry — all metal must be warm gold
- No additional jewelry beyond the three bangles
- No crystals, candles, incense, or spiritual prop clichés in background
- Avoid AI-generated hand artifacts — natural skin texture, correct finger count, no fused knuckles
- No more than 3 bangles visible
- Avoid heavy makeup or styled hair that reads as campaign-commercial rather than editorial

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm color grade: amber highlights, cream shadows, suppress cool channel
- Skin tone retouching: light and natural — enhance warmth, do not over-smooth
- Text overlay: clean serif charm labels in warm gold (#ab8c52); headline in cream serif; CTA in off-white sans-serif
- Produce three skin tone variants for A/B testing (Fitzpatrick II, III–IV, V)
- Dodge and burn lightly on bangles to enhance gold specular highlights
- Ensure charm legibility — localized sharpening on bangle area if needed
- Warm vignette, very subtle — drawing eye to wrist area
