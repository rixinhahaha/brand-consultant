## Brand Visual Direction
This variation leans into texture and material warmth as its primary emotional language. A woman's wrist rests gently on a richly tactile surface — warm linen, nubby boucle, or natural cotton weave — photographed with soft, fully diffused light that reveals surface grain without casting hard shadows. The visual mood is grounded and serene: the kind of quiet, unhurried warmth that feels like a slow weekend morning. The brand's nurturing, collectible quality is expressed through material richness rather than drama or mood lighting.

## Generation Prompt
> A soft, fully diffused lifestyle photograph of a woman's wrist and forearm, medium-warm skin tone, resting naturally on a richly textured warm surface — a thick natural linen, nubby cream boucle, or loosely woven cotton textile with visible fiber depth. Three Alex and Ani gold charm bangles are stacked on the wrist — anchor, crescent moon phase, and shooting star charms — all facing upward and clearly legible. The light is even, fully diffused, and warm, as if filtered through a white curtain over a large north-facing window: no hard shadows, no specular glare, every surface rendered with gentle clarity. The texture of the fabric ground is visible and rich — fiber by fiber — in sharp contrast to the smooth gold of the bangles. The wrist rests at a natural diagonal across the lower half of the square frame, leaving the upper half open as a soft textured ground for text. Color palette is warm ivory, aged natural linen, burnished honey gold, and sun-warmed skin. The overall mood is serene, grounded, and intimate — the feeling of waking up slowly on a warm morning. Shot at medium-close distance, 50–75mm equivalent, moderate depth of field keeping both the bangles and the foreground fabric texture in focus while the background softens gently. Color-graded with gentle warmth: even champagne tone, lifted shadows, cream-tinted negative space.

## Composition & Layout
- **Composition:** Diagonal placement — forearm and wrist run from lower-left to lower-right across the bottom half of the square frame; upper half is open textured ground
- **Perspective:** Slightly above eye level — approximately 30–40 degrees above horizontal; angled to reveal both the top of the bangles and the surface texture
- **Framing:** Square format with generous surface visible above the wrist; forearm exits frame at left and right edges naturally
- **Focal point:** The stacked bangles — all three charms in focus; the contrast of smooth gold against rough linen fiber draws the eye immediately

## Subject & Arrangement
- **Primary subject:** Woman's wrist and forearm wearing three gold charm bangles, resting on a warm textured textile surface
- **Positioning:** Forearm lies flat and relaxed on the surface, wrist centered horizontally in the lower third
- **Props/styling:** Textured textile surface as primary prop — thick woven linen, boucle, or cotton in warm ivory/cream; no other props
- **Scale:** Medium-close — bangles clearly legible, fabric texture visible; intimate but not macro-extreme

## Lighting
- **Key light:** Large, fully diffused overhead-and-slightly-frontal source — simulates overcast sky or white curtain-filtered window
- **Fill:** Full ambient wrap — effectively no hard shadows; all surfaces illuminated softly and evenly
- **Color temperature:** 4800–5200K, warmed in grade to champagne quality
- **Mood:** Serene, warm, unhurried — the light of a quiet morning, revealing texture and warmth without drama

## Color Palette & Grading
- **Dominant colors:** Warm ivory-cream (textile), honey gold (#ab8c52) (bangles), soft peach-amber (skin)
- **Accent colors:** Natural linen fiber variation (warm flax to pale straw); aged brass in bangle wire
- **Grade:** Even, lifted, warm-neutral — reduce contrast slightly from standard; open shadows to cream; highlights gentle and warm, not blown; full-frame warmth without directional color cast

## Background & Environment
- **Setting:** Abstract surface — the textile IS the environment; no additional background visible
- **Surface/backdrop:** Richly textured natural textile — thick linen, nubby boucle, or loosely woven cotton in warm ivory or pale champagne; fiber texture sharp in the foreground, softening slightly at the upper frame edge
- **Depth of field:** Moderate — f/4–5.6 equivalent; bangles and immediate surface texture sharp; surface at upper frame edge slightly soft

## Typography Direction
- **Text placement:** Upper half of the square frame — over the open textured surface above the wrist; headline centered or slightly left-aligned; charm name labels arranged vertically at left margin beside each bangle; CTA anchored at bottom-center below wrist
- **Font style:** Warm, humanist serif for headline — feels handcrafted but refined; clean sans-serif for charm names and CTA
- **Color:** Deep warm brown or charcoal for headline text (readable against light linen ground); warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm name labels; off-white for CTA on any darker bar

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani anchor charm bangle, moon phase bangle, shooting star bangle (product reference for charm detail and proportion)
- Warm textile surface references: natural linen, cream boucle, raw cotton weave
- Brand swatch: warm gold #ab8c52, ivory, warm flax linen

## Style References
- Kinfolk magazine material-focused product photography — texture, warmth, restraint
- Aesop brand imagery — surface texture as atmosphere, diffused natural light
- Linen House and Parachute Home brand photography — fabric texture as protagonist
- Jacquemus campaign still-life work — natural materials, warm palette, unhurried composition

## Negative Prompts
- No white, grey, cool, or synthetic backgrounds — warm natural textile surfaces only
- No marble, slate, acrylic, or non-organic surfaces
- No hard shadows — light must be fully diffused and even
- No cool-toned or silver jewelry — all metal warm gold
- No more than 3 bangles in frame
- No additional props: no crystals, flowers, candles, incense, tarot, fruit, or styling clichés
- Avoid AI-generated hand artifacts — natural skin and finger texture at this scale
- No high-contrast or dramatic lighting — this variation is intentionally soft

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm even color grade: champagne-lifted shadows, gentle warm midtones, no cool channel
- Emphasis on surface texture rendering — do not over-soften or over-smooth in grade; preserve fiber detail
- Charm legibility check: ensure anchor, moon, star charms are individually identifiable at 1:1 Instagram size
- Text overlay: headline in deep warm brown or charcoal (readable on light linen); charm name labels in warm gold (#ab8c52) serif; CTA in off-white sans-serif
- Produce three skin tone variants for A/B testing (Fitzpatrick II, III–IV, V)
- Consider two textile surface colorway variants: warm ivory linen and pale champagne boucle
- Minimal retouching — surface texture and skin should feel authentic and natural
- Slight warm vignette along the upper edge only — drawing attention down toward the wrist
