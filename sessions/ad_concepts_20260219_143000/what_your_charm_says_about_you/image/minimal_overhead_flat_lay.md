# What Your Charm Says About You — Minimal Overhead Flat Lay
**Format:** Static | **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square)
**Ad Copy:** "Every charm has a meaning. This one is yours." / "The anchor. The moon. The star. Each Alex and Ani charm carries researched symbolism — choose the one that speaks to who you are right now."
**CTA:** Find Your Charm

## Brand Visual Direction
This variation strips the composition to its most essential elements — three charm bangles arranged deliberately on a warm linen surface, shot directly overhead with soft, even diffused light. The visual language is clean and considered, closer to product art direction than lifestyle photography. The warmth comes entirely from material and color — the gold of the metal, the grain of natural linen, the cream of the ground — without relying on mood lighting or narrative context.

## Generation Prompt
> A directly overhead flat-lay photograph of three Alex and Ani gold charm bangles arranged in a loose, intentional cluster on a warm natural linen surface. The bangles are slightly overlapping but each charm is clearly visible and facing upward: an anchor charm, a crescent moon phase charm, and a shooting star charm. Light is soft, even, and diffused — as if from a large north-facing window or a fully overcast sky — with no harsh shadows, creating a clean, almost luminous quality across the gold metal. The linen surface beneath shows natural fiber texture, warm ivory in color with subtle woven variation. The composition is centered with generous negative space around the bangles, leaving the upper third of the frame open for typography. Color palette is warm gold, aged brass, and natural ivory. The overall feeling is editorial product photography — deliberate, quiet, considered. Shot from directly above at 90 degrees, creating a graphic, symmetrical quality. Color-graded with gentle warmth: champagne highlights, soft cream shadows, no cool tones.

## Composition & Layout
- **Composition:** Centered cluster of bangles with deliberate negative space — upper third clear for headline; lower third open for CTA
- **Perspective:** Directly overhead, 90 degrees — pure flat-lay
- **Framing:** Bangles occupy center third of frame; generous linen ground visible on all sides
- **Focal point:** The anchor charm — positioned at the visual center of the bangle arrangement

## Subject & Arrangement
- **Primary subject:** Three Alex and Ani gold charm bangles — anchor, moon phase, shooting star
- **Positioning:** Loosely clustered at center, slightly overlapping, charms all rotated to face upward
- **Props/styling:** No additional props — linen surface only; spare, intentional
- **Scale:** Medium — bangles at approximately 40% of frame width; enough detail to read charms clearly

## Lighting
- **Key light:** Large, soft diffused overhead source — simulates overcast window light or large softbox above
- **Fill:** Ambient wrap — essentially shadowless, with only subtle directional shading from bangle depth
- **Color temperature:** 5000–5500K base, warmed in grade to 4600K feel
- **Mood:** Clean, considered, luminous — not moody, but warm and honest

## Color Palette & Grading
- **Dominant colors:** Warm gold (#ab8c52), natural ivory linen, aged brass
- **Accent colors:** Subtle warm shadow at bangle underside; soft highlight bloom on charm faces
- **Grade:** Even, warm-neutral grade; slight lift in warm midtones; suppress any cool cast from overhead light; keep shadows open and cream-toned

## Background & Environment
- **Setting:** Pure product surface — abstract, no environmental context
- **Surface/backdrop:** Natural woven linen textile, ivory-cream, with visible fiber grain; flat and even
- **Depth of field:** Deep — full-frame sharpness from bangle to linen surface; f/8 equivalent

## Typography Direction
- **Text placement:** Upper third — headline centered above bangles; charm names labeled near each bangle with small serif text; CTA anchored at bottom center
- **Font style:** Clean, refined serif for headline and charm labels; lightweight sans-serif for body copy
- **Color:** Warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm name labels; deep warm brown or charcoal for headline on light ground; cream for CTA on any darker overlay

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm color grade: even champagne tone across the frame; no cool channel bleed
- Sharpen charm details in post — anchor, moon, star must be legible at 300px width
- Text overlay: serif charm name labels near each bangle in warm gold (#ab8c52); headline in deep warm tone above
- Produce three background linen tone variants for A/B testing (ivory, warm flax, pale champagne)
- Maintain deep-focus sharpness throughout — no artificial blur in post
- Light retouching on linen surface if needed to remove unwanted marks or lint
