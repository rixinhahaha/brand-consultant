# What Your Charm Says About You — Golden Hour Wrist Close-Up
**Format:** Static | **Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 (portrait)
**Ad Copy:** "Every charm has a meaning. This one is yours." / "The anchor. The moon. The star. Each Alex and Ani charm carries researched symbolism — choose the one that speaks to who you are right now."
**CTA:** Find Your Charm

## Brand Visual Direction
This variation lives in the warmest register of the Alex and Ani palette — golden-amber light raking across skin and metal at a low angle, evoking the last 30 minutes of afternoon sun. The color story is concentrated: deep honey, burnished gold, and the soft blush of sun-warmed skin against a barely-there cream ground. The mood is intimate and unhurried, as if the viewer has caught a private moment of stillness.

## Generation Prompt
> A close-up editorial photograph of a woman's forearm and wrist, medium-warm skin tone, shot slightly above eye level at a gentle three-quarter angle. Three gold Alex and Ani charm bangles are stacked neatly on the wrist — an anchor charm, a crescent moon phase charm, and a shooting star charm — each charm facing upward and fully legible, catching warm directional golden-hour light from the left side of frame. The light source is soft but highly directional, casting shallow, defined shadows across the ridges of each charm and glancing warmly across the skin. Background is a softly blurred cream linen textile, out of focus at f/2.0 equivalent, rendering as a smooth warm neutral wash. The overall palette is honey gold, burnished brass, and warm champagne. The photograph is quiet, personal, and editorial in character — unposed, natural, as if the subject is simply resting their arm on a window ledge in afternoon sun. Shot in the style of intimate fine jewelry editorial photography, color-graded with warm amber highlights and lifted cream shadows.

## Composition & Layout
- **Composition:** Rule of thirds — the stacked bangles occupy the lower-left two-thirds, leaving upper-right breathing room for text overlay
- **Perspective:** Slightly above eye level, three-quarter angle looking down at the wrist from the left
- **Framing:** Forearm fills frame from mid-frame to lower edge; fingertips partially in frame, soft and natural; no sharp crop at the wrist joint
- **Focal point:** The anchor charm — centered on the bangle stack, sharpest element in the frame

## Subject & Arrangement
- **Primary subject:** Woman's forearm and wrist, medium-warm skin tone (Fitzpatrick III–IV)
- **Positioning:** Wrist angled naturally at rest, forearm running diagonally from lower-left to upper-right across frame
- **Props/styling:** Three gold charm bangles stacked — anchor lowest, moon phase center, shooting star uppermost; charms rotated to face upward and slightly toward camera
- **Scale:** Macro-to-close-up — bangles are large enough that individual charm details are clearly readable at thumbnail size

## Lighting
- **Key light:** Warm directional golden-hour light from camera-left at roughly 30 degrees, low angle
- **Fill:** Minimal — let right-side shadows hold; a faint warm bounce from the cream linen surface below
- **Color temperature:** 4800–5200K (golden hour window light)
- **Mood:** Intimate, warm, personal — light behaves like late afternoon sun through glass, not a studio setup

## Color Palette & Grading
- **Dominant colors:** Honey gold (#ab8c52), warm skin tone (peach-amber), champagne cream
- **Accent colors:** Deep brass shadow in charm recesses, soft blush highlight on skin peaks
- **Grade:** Pull highlights toward golden-amber; lift shadows to warm cream base; desaturate cool channel; add subtle warm vignette at edges

## Background & Environment
- **Setting:** Interior window ledge or soft surface implied — no specific environment visible
- **Surface/backdrop:** Cream linen textile, softly textured, rendered out of focus
- **Depth of field:** Shallow — f/2.0 equivalent; bangles sharp, background fully dissolved into warm wash

## Typography Direction
- **Text placement:** Upper-right quadrant — headline "Every charm has a meaning. This one is yours." set in warm gold; lower-left near wrist — small CTA "Find Your Charm"
- **Font style:** Clean serif (think Cormorant or Freight Display) for headline; minimal sans-serif for CTA
- **Color:** Warm gold (#ab8c52) for headline; off-white/cream for CTA text

## Negative Prompts
- No white or grey backgrounds — cream, linen, or warm neutral only
- No cool-toned or silver metal — all jewelry must read as warm gold
- No crystals, incense, tarot cards, or spiritual prop clichés
- No more than 3 bangles in frame
- Avoid AI-generated hand artifacts — no extra fingers, fused knuckles, unnatural skin texture
- No harsh studio strobe or flat frontal lighting
- No clinical or fashion-catalog aesthetic — keep it personal and editorial

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm color grade: pull highlights toward golden-amber, lift shadows toward warm cream, suppress cold blue channel
- Text overlay: clean serif in warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm names; sans-serif in off-white for supporting copy and CTA
- Produce three skin tone variants for A/B testing (Fitzpatrick II, III–IV, V)
- Add subtle warm vignette — not dark, just a gentle focusing of warmth toward center
- Sharpen charm details in post if needed; charms must be legible at mobile feed size
- No heavy skin retouching — keep natural texture and warmth
