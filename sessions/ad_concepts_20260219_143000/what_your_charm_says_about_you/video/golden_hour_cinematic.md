## Brand Visual Direction
This variation is bathed in the last twenty minutes of golden hour — that specific quality of late afternoon sun that turns everything it touches into something worth keeping. The color palette burns at the warm end: deep amber, honey gold, and the luminous ochre glow that rakes across metal and skin alike. This is not the intimate documentary of everyday life — this is the elevated, cinematic version of self-knowledge: slow, deliberate, and quietly gorgeous. Gimbal-smooth movement, wide lenses that place the subject within a world rather than isolating them from it.

## Generation Prompt
> Vertical 9:16 cinematic format, shot entirely on a smooth gimbal with deliberate, choreographed camera movement — every motion purposeful and composed. Opens on an extreme overhead close-up of a gold anchor charm bangle on a warm cream surface, raked by low-angle golden hour sunlight streaming through a window or doorway from the left; the light catches the charm's texture and sends a warm flare across the frame. A woman's hand with natural, warm skin tone enters and lifts the bangle, the light catching the inside of her wrist as she does. Cut to a medium shot, slightly low angle, as the same woman — late 20s, loose linen, layered necklaces — slides the anchor bangle onto her wrist against the other two; a gimbal slow push-in from thigh to wrist level captures the action while the golden hour backlight halos her forearm and makes the metal glow. A three-cut montage follows: moon charm bangle on a wrist, a low-angle gimbal drift upward; star charm stacking in, caught by a lateral gimbal glide; a hand lifting a heart charm into direct golden sunlight, the charm becoming semi-translucent at its edges in the flare — each cut synced to a guitar pluck, each shot smooth and deliberate. The woman returns, now in a slight three-quarter angle, wrist raised so bangles catch the golden hour light in a constellation of warm reflections; she turns to camera with composed certainty and speaks. Final scene: a slow gimbal drift across charm bangles on a warm cream surface, the late sun now lower and more directional, casting long warm shadows from each charm's detail — the Alex and Ani wordmark materializes in warm serif. Throughout: color grade pushed deep into golden amber, with crushed warm shadows, glowing highlights, and a cinematic 2.4:1 aspect ratio letterbox converted to fill the 9:16 frame vertically. Music: fingerpicked acoustic guitar building gently toward a soft swell.

## Scene 1 — Golden Reveal (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Extreme close-up transitioning to close-up as hand enters
- **Camera angle:** Overhead, true vertical, then slight tilt as hand enters
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal — begins locked-off overhead; as hand enters, a slow 3-second descending drift brings the camera 10cm closer to the bangle
- **Framing:** Bangle in lower-center third; hand enters from right; warm light rakes across the left side of the frame

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour sunlight from camera-left, extremely low angle (approximately 15 degrees above horizon), raking across the cream surface
- **Quality:** Hard-edged, directional, warm — approximately 2700K; creates sharp shadow from charm detail
- **Mood:** Luminous, reverent — this is not ambient warmth but active, almost ceremonial golden light

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Gold anchor charm bangle on cream linen or cotton surface; woman's hand with warm skin tone
- **Action:** Hand reaches in from the right, lifts the bangle; the metal catches the raking light and briefly flares warm gold
- **Expression:** No face — the deliberateness of the hand gesture carries full emotional weight

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm cream surface extending into a soft warm-toned background — a windowsill, a low wooden surface bathed in golden light
- **Depth of field:** Very shallow, f/1.4 equivalent — charm in critical focus, golden flare in background soft and warm

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm gold (#ab8c52) charm, cream surface, warm amber light, deep golden shadow
- **Grade:** Pushed golden-amber; shadows warmed and slightly crushed (not pure black — rich amber-brown); highlights allowed to bloom slightly at the warm end

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Single fingerpicked acoustic guitar note, warm and resonant
- **Text overlay:** "This isn't just a bracelet." — clean serif, warm gold (#ab8c52), appears on cut at lower third

## Scene 2 — The Intention (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium shot, slightly low angle
- **Camera angle:** Low angle — camera at approximately wrist height, looking upward at a 20-degree angle toward the woman
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal slow push-in — begins at thigh/hip height, rises smoothly over 4 seconds to settle at wrist level as she slides the bangle on
- **Framing:** Lower frame: wrist action and bangle stacking; upper frame: her face catching golden backlight; rule of thirds — face in upper third, wrist in lower third

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour backlight from behind and above — sun positions behind the subject, creating a warm halo around her hair and shoulders
- **Quality:** Warm backlit rim light; soft frontal fill from natural bounce off cream surfaces in the room; approximately 3000K in rim, 4000K in fill
- **Mood:** Elevated, almost sacred — the backlight confers importance without being heavy-handed

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman, late 20s, loose linen shirt warm toned, layered gold necklaces
- **Action:** Slides anchor bangle onto wrist alongside two others; glances down with a quiet private smile; the gimbal rising from below frames this as a moment of arrival
- **Expression:** Soft satisfaction — the smile is inward; the backlight makes her look luminous

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm interior or transitional outdoor space — a porch, a window alcove; soft golden background fully blown out to a warm amber glow
- **Depth of field:** Moderate, f/2.0 equivalent — her face and wrist both sharp; background fully resolved into warm amber glow

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Golden backlight, warm skin tone, cream linen, gold bangles
- **Grade:** Consistent golden push; backlight bloom preserved; skin tones remain warm and natural, not orange

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** Warm female voice, measured and grounded: "The anchor. It means you're someone who stays grounded — no matter what."
- **Music:** Acoustic guitar continues — a second note added, building very gently
- **Text overlay:** None

## Scene 3 — Charm Montage (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up (each cut)
- **Camera angle:** (a) Low angle, camera below wrist looking up at moon charm against golden sky or window; (b) Side angle — lateral gimbal glide left-to-right catching star bangle mid-stack; (c) Near-macro, camera at charm level, heart charm raised into golden sunlight
- **Camera movement:** (a) Gimbal slow upward drift; (b) Smooth lateral gimbal glide; (c) Locked-off, subject moves charm into light; each cut is one distinct, smooth movement
- **Framing:** Each shot frames the charm and wrist against maximum golden light — the charm is the subject, the light is the environment

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour throughout — each shot uses the same low-angle warm sunlight; (c) backlit, heart charm catches light at its edges
- **Quality:** Warm, directional — metal surfaces catch and reflect the golden light actively; approximately 2700–3000K
- **Mood:** Kinetic reverence — the light elevates each charm to something worth lingering over

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Three wrists with different skin tones — (a) lighter warm skin tone, moon charm; (b) deeper warm skin tone, star charm stacking; (c) medium warm skin tone, heart charm
- **Action:** (a) Moon bangle settles as camera drifts up; (b) Star bangle slides into place as camera glides past; (c) Heart charm lifted into golden backlight, semi-backlit
- **Expression:** Hands only — gesture is slow and intentional, matching the cinematic pacing

### Environment
- **Background:** (a) Warm out-of-focus amber — window or outdoor warm light; (b) Warm cream interior soft focus; (c) Pure golden backlight — near-white with amber warmth
- **Depth of field:** Very shallow throughout — charms sharp, backgrounds fully diffused

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm gold on varied skin tones; all backgrounds amber or champagne
- **Grade:** Same golden push; (c) backlit shot allowed to bloom warm at highlight edge — intentional golden flare around heart charm

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Guitar pluck synced to each cut — three individual notes, evenly paced
- **Text overlay:** On each cut: (a) "Moon. Intuition." (b) "Star. Courage." (c) "Heart. Love you give freely." — clean serif, warm gold (#ab8c52), lower-third, appears on cut

## Scene 4 — Composed Address (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up, slightly wider than Scene 2
- **Camera angle:** Eye level, slight three-quarter angle — camera positioned 15 degrees to the right of her eyeline, then she turns to face it
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal — very slow push-in, barely perceptible over 4 seconds; begins mid-movement as she turns toward camera
- **Framing:** Her face occupies upper two-thirds; wrist with bangles raised slightly visible in lower-left quarter; golden backlight creates separation from background

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour from camera-right, slightly behind — side-rim lighting her face; soft frontal bounce fill from left
- **Quality:** Warm side-rim at approximately 2800K; frontal fill soft and diffused at 4500K; creates dimensional lighting with a warm rim and soft face
- **Mood:** Composed, luminous — she looks like someone who has arrived at an answer, not someone seeking one

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Same woman, wrist with stacked bangles partially in frame lower-left
- **Action:** Turns from slight angle to face camera directly; speaks the line; wrist rises slightly as if unconsciously during speech
- **Expression:** Settled certainty — the confidence of self-knowledge, not performance

- **Background:** Golden hour ambient glow, fully out of focus — amber and warm ochre
- **Depth of field:** Shallow, f/2.0 equivalent — face sharp, background warm blur, bangles on wrist slightly soft

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm golden rim on skin tone, soft front fill, gold bangles
- **Grade:** Same golden grade; slight warm vignette to draw eye; no cool tones anywhere in the frame

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** Sync to lip movement: "I didn't pick this one because it's pretty. I picked it because it's mine."
- **Music:** Guitar continues — notes building toward a very soft final resolution
- **Text overlay:** None

## Scene 5 — Golden Still Life (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up
- **Camera angle:** Low angle — camera at surface level, looking across the bangles rather than down at them
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal slow lateral drift from left to right across the bangle grouping; begins on anchor charm and reveals the others as it moves
- **Framing:** Bangles occupy lower two-thirds of frame; warm golden light streaks horizontally across frame from camera-left; wordmark resolves in upper-right

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour sun now very low — raking light at approximately 5 degrees above the surface, creating long warm shadows from each charm detail; dramatic but warm
- **Quality:** Hard, directional, extremely warm — approximately 2500K; the lowest quality of light in the piece, most cinematic
- **Mood:** Still, final, luminous — the light of a day well-spent

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Three to four gold charm bangles on cream linen, loosely arranged
- **Action:** Camera drifts laterally, catching each charm in sequence; wordmark resolves in frame
- **Expression:** Product — metal quality fully demonstrated by the directional light catching charm details

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm cream linen; long golden shadows extending from bangles across the surface; background goes to warm amber blur
- **Depth of field:** Moderate shallow, f/2.2 equivalent — nearest bangles razor sharp, furthest slightly soft

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Deep gold (#ab8c52), cream, amber shadows, warm ochre ambient
- **Grade:** Most saturated golden moment in the piece — controlled, not garish; shadows warm amber-brown, not black

### Text & Audio

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani anchor, moon, star, and heart charm bangle product photography
- Brand lifestyle imagery with golden hour or warm natural light
- Alex and Ani wordmark in warm gold/off-white
- Lifestyle imagery of charm bangles stacked on diverse warm skin tones

## Style References
- Gorjana "Wear Your Intention" editorial aesthetic — elevated minimal
- Terrence Malick golden hour cinematography — natural backlight, foreground subject in warm rim
- Luca Guadagnino film visual language — slow, deliberate, warm, composed
- Kinfolk magazine golden hour editorial photography

## Negative Prompts
- No cool-toned or silver jewelry — all metal must be warm gold
- No white or grey backgrounds — cream, warm amber, and skin tones only
- No flat-lay hands with perfect manicures or stock photography hand poses
- No spiritual cliches: no crystals, incense, tarot cards, or candles
- No artificially generated or obviously synthetic-looking hands or wrists
- No studio strobe or artificial hard lighting — all light must read as natural golden hour
- No overly fast cuts or montage that breaks the cinematic pacing
- No cool color grading or desaturated film looks — this is warm and golden throughout
- No lens flares that read as artificial or digital (avoid rainbow or anamorphic-style artificial flares)
- No gimbal movement that is jerky, bouncy, or reads as handheld

## Post-Production Notes
- Color grade: deepest golden push in the piece — highlights to warm amber-gold bloom; shadows crushed to warm amber-brown (not black); midtones warm and slightly saturated; all cool tones removed from the grade entirely
- Text overlays appear on cut — no fade-in; text is immediate
- Serif typeface in warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm names; sans-serif off-white for supporting copy and CTA
- Guitar plucks in Scene 3 must be frame-accurate to each cut — sync in post
- Captions burned in for sound-off viewing — placed lower-third, not obscuring bangles or charm detail
- Scene transitions: all hard cuts except final wordmark which dissolves in over 1 second
- The gimbal push-in in Scene 4 should be so slow it is only perceptible by comparing first and last frame — not a visible zoom or push
- Golden hour color temperature should be consistent across all scenes — if shot at different times, match in grade to 2700–3000K equivalent for key light scenes
- No stabilization adjustments needed in post — gimbal footage should require no additional smoothing
