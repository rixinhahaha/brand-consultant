# What Your Charm Says About You — Raw Creator Confessional
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok Video | **Duration:** 18s | **Scenes:** 5
**Ad Copy:** Every charm has a meaning. This one is yours. The anchor. The moon. The star. Each Alex and Ani charm carries researched symbolism — not decoration, but intention. Choose the one that speaks to who you are right now.
**CTA:** Find Your Charm

## Brand Visual Direction
This variation is built entirely around the creator native format — the video should feel like it belongs on a For You Page between genuine personal content. The camera is a phone held at arm's length or slightly below; the light is whatever is available in a real room at a real time of day. Warm afternoon sun through a window, a reading lamp, the ambient glow of a lived-in space. There are no setups here — only moments. The brand appears through the authenticity of the person wearing the jewelry, not through production value. The gold of the bangles is the most polished thing in the frame, which is exactly the point.

## Generation Prompt
> Vertical 9:16 format, shot entirely in the creator native style — camera held at arm's length or propped on a surface at personal level, mimicking a phone camera self-shoot; slight natural instability throughout, the kind that comes from a human arm holding a device rather than a handheld rig. Opens on a low phone-camera overhead: a gold anchor charm bangle on a warm cream surface, natural room light from a nearby window providing the only illumination — warm, directional, imperfect. A hand reaches in from just below the camera, fingers slightly awkward and real, and lifts the bangle. Cut to a medium self-shot at arm's length: the same woman, shot from slightly above (the phone-camera above-eye-level self-shoot angle), linen shirt, layered gold necklaces, slides the anchor bangle onto her wrist with her other hand; she glances at her wrist and back to camera with the ease of someone talking to her phone, not performing for one. The charm montage is shot as three rapid creator-style cuts — each one a different person's wrist in their own environment (a kitchen counter, a wooden desk, a bedside table), each pulling or showing the bangle to camera the way you would show something to a friend on video call, natural and slightly imperfect; text overlays appear mid-clip in the way TikTok captions do. The direct address is the emotional center: the woman holds the phone at slightly below eye level, arms slightly bent, speaking to the camera the way she would record a voice memo that accidentally became something more — the intimacy of the direct phone-camera gaze, the slight imperfection of self-shot framing, making the words land with the weight of a real confession. Final scene: she flips the camera to show her wrist, a quick natural motion, the bangles catching whatever room light is available, then the wordmark and CTA appear over the image. Color grade: warm, slightly mobile-video-esque — not overcorrected; a light warm pass that feels like a good phone camera in a warm room, not a color suite.

## Scene 1 — Phone Overhead (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Overhead close-up — phone camera held above the surface
- **Camera angle:** Overhead, approximately 70 degrees from horizontal — not perfectly vertical; the natural angle of a phone held above an object
- **Camera movement:** Slight natural tremor from hand-held phone; not a deliberate handheld motion — the micro-instability of an arm extended overhead
- **Framing:** Bangle in center-lower area of frame; hand enters from the bottom edge — the natural framing of a phone camera held above and looking down; some of the surface extends to the frame edges

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Natural room light — window light from the right, warm afternoon; no supplemental light; the bangle catches direct window sun on one edge
- **Quality:** Directional but uncontrolled — warmer where the sun catches the metal, cooler in the shadows; this imperfection is intentional
- **Mood:** Real and immediate — the light of a real room at a real time; not set up for anything

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Gold anchor charm bangle on cream surface (a bedside table surface, a light wood desk, a cotton scarf — some real-life surface); woman's hand with natural unpainted nails
- **Action:** Hand reaches in from the bottom of frame — slightly awkward angle, the way your own arm looks in a self-shot overhead — and picks up the bangle; the motion is natural and slightly imperfect
- **Expression:** No face; the realness of the hand's gesture carries authenticity

### Environment
- **Background:** A real surface in a real space — warm wood grain, cream fabric, or a neutral surface that is not styled into anything; objects may be partially visible at frame edges (a phone edge, a book spine, a cup) but should not overwhelm
- **Depth of field:** Deep, f/4.0–5.6 equivalent (phone camera natural depth of field at this distance) — most of the frame is in reasonable focus

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm gold bangle, cream or warm neutral surface, natural room light
- **Grade:** Light warm pass — the baseline is what a good phone camera captures in natural warm light; slight saturation boost in warm tones only; no heavy grading

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Soft fabric rustle, metallic chime — actual room sound, not designed sound effects; sparse guitar begins
- **Text overlay:** "This isn't just a bracelet." — appears mid-clip, not on cut; styled as a caption, clean serif warm gold (#ab8c52), lower third; the timing is creator-native (text appears while action is happening, not strictly on cut)

## Scene 2 — Self-Shot Slide (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium self-shot — phone held at arm's length above and slightly in front
- **Camera angle:** Slightly above eye level — the natural above-eye-level angle of a phone-camera self-shot; looks slightly down at the subject
- **Camera movement:** The arm holding the phone is slightly extended and not perfectly steady — the natural instability of a self-shot arm; she shifts slightly as she uses her other hand to slide the bangle
- **Framing:** Her face in upper two-thirds; wrist action happening below; the natural crop of a self-shot that includes her face and the wrist action simultaneously

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Natural window light from camera-left — same warm afternoon directional quality; hitting her face with a gentle shadow on the right; no supplemental lighting
- **Quality:** Natural and directional; slightly more frontal than it would be in a set-dressed production because the self-shot angle naturally faces her toward the window; warm 4800K
- **Mood:** Comfortable self-disclosure — the light of a bedroom or living room, not a studio; this is the light she lives in

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Same woman, linen shirt, layered necklaces; wrist visible below; phone held at arm's length
- **Action:** Slides the anchor bangle onto her wrist with her free hand; glances from her wrist back to camera; the look back to camera is slightly casual — not a camera-ready moment, a natural return of gaze
- **Expression:** The warmth of sharing something — not performed joy; a slight lift at the corner of the mouth that belongs to genuine enjoyment

### Environment
- **Background:** A real interior — a bedroom or living room; soft out-of-focus background with warm ambient tones; books, plants, or a neutral wall visible but not styled or centered
- **Depth of field:** Moderate, f/2.8 equivalent (phone portrait mode equivalent) — face and wrist moderately sharp; background separated naturally

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm skin tone, gold bangles, warm interior background
- **Grade:** Consistent light warm pass; phone portrait mode color science as baseline

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** Her own voice, directly synced to lip movement — warm but conversational, not VO-booth polished: "The anchor. It means you're someone who stays grounded — no matter what."
- **Music:** Guitar continues, sparse
- **Text overlay:** None (her voice is the text; the VO is the copy)

## Scene 3 — Creator Wrist Pulls (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up self-shot and near-macro wrist shots — mixed; each shot a different creator in their own space shooting their own wrist
- **Camera angle:** (a) Phone held at arm's length, camera pointing down at wrist resting on a surface — creator showing-off angle; (b) Wrist held up toward camera, filling frame — the "look at this" angle; (c) Phone held in one hand while other hand lifts heart charm toward camera lens
- **Camera movement:** Each shot has its own natural instability — these are three different people in three different environments; (a) slight drift as the arm adjusts, (b) the wrist wobbles slightly as it's held up, (c) the charm approaches the lens slightly imperfectly
- **Framing:** Each shot is framed the way someone would actually frame a wrist shot for a social post — not editorial, not over-composed; some may be slightly off-center, slightly cropped

### Lighting
- **Key light:** (a) Natural kitchen window light — warm but slightly cooler than the main woman's room; (b) A warm reading lamp or bedside light — more amber; (c) Natural morning light — softer and slightly more neutral; all warm, all different
- **Quality:** Intentionally inconsistent across the three — the visual variety of three different human environments; all within the warm spectrum
- **Mood:** User-generated authenticity — three different people, three different spaces, one shared thing: the charm, and what it means

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** (a) Lighter warm skin tone, moon charm bangle, kitchen environment; (b) Deeper warm skin tone, star charm bangle stacked, bedroom/desk environment; (c) Medium warm skin tone, heart charm held toward camera, morning environment
- **Action:** (a) Creator pans their phone down to show the moon bangle sitting on their wrist on a table surface; (b) Creator holds wrist up toward camera — the "look at this" gesture — star bangles stacked; (c) Creator brings the heart charm close to the lens with their fingers
- **Expression:** No faces except possibly partial chin/jaw at the top of frame in (a); hands and wrists are the full subject

### Environment
- **Background:** (a) Kitchen counter, warm wood or white (warm-toned tile if present); (b) Desk surface or bedding — warm neutral; (c) Near-window with soft ambient light behind
- **Depth of field:** Mixed — phone cameras at different distances give different depth; (c) charm close to lens will naturally fall out of focus slightly at the bangle further back

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold charms on varied warm skin tones; three distinct warm environmental palettes
- **Grade:** Each shot retains its own slightly different warmth — do not color-match them to identical grades; the variety confirms they are real, different people

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Guitar pluck synced to each cut — three notes, as in all other variations; here the sync feels like it rhymes with the creator cut rhythm
- **Text overlay:** Appears mid-clip on each cut (creator-caption style): (a) "Moon. Intuition." (b) "Star. Courage." (c) "Heart. Love you give freely." — clean serif, warm gold (#ab8c52); creator-native placement (slightly higher in frame than default lower-third in (a) and (b) if composition demands)

## Scene 4 — The Confession (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium self-shot — the primary direct address; this is the emotional center of the confessional format
- **Camera angle:** Slightly below eye level — the rarer, more intimate phone camera angle; the camera looking slightly up at her creates a subtle sense of vulnerability and honesty
- **Camera movement:** Very slight natural tremor from the arm holding the phone; her arms are slightly bent, not fully extended — the phone is closer than a typical self-shot, making it feel more intimate; she may shift slightly mid-speech as comfort takes over from self-consciousness
- **Framing:** Her face occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame; the wrist with bangles is in the lower third, slightly out of full focus; this is the phone camera frame of a personal voice memo that became something more

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Natural window light from the left — the same room as Scene 1 and 2; warm afternoon quality; directional enough to model her face without being harsh; shadow side falls off naturally to the right
- **Quality:** Natural, warm, slightly imperfect — a highlight may clip slightly on her cheek or forearm; this is not a flaw, it is authenticity
- **Mood:** Confessional intimacy — the light does not make her look beautiful in the editorial sense; it makes her look real, which is more powerful in this format

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Same woman; wrist with stacked bangles in lower-frame
- **Action:** Speaks directly to the phone camera; may shift or adjust her arm grip mid-speech; her wrist rises slightly toward camera as she speaks the word "mine"
- **Expression:** The specific expression of saying something true — not performed confidence; the slight breath before speaking, the direct gaze that comes from meaning it

### Environment
- **Background:** The same real interior as Scene 2 — soft, warm, recognizable to the viewer as the same space; continuity matters in the confessional format
- **Depth of field:** Moderate (phone portrait mode) — face sharp; background and wrist slightly softer

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm skin, gold bangles, warm room ambient
- **Grade:** Same light warm pass; no additional grading that separates this from the other scenes — the consistency confirms it is the same space and moment

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** Sync to lip movement — her voice, direct and unhurried: "I didn't pick this one because it's pretty. I picked it because it's mine."
- **Music:** Guitar has reduced to near-silence; a single ambient held note beneath her voice; her voice is the primary audio
- **Text overlay:** A caption burn-in of her spoken words — not because it is a text overlay for the ad, but because burned captions are the native format; clean sans-serif, off-white, lower-third

---

## Scene 5 — The Wrist Flip (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up — the natural phone wrist-flip shot
- **Camera angle:** Begins as a continuation of Scene 4 medium shot, then she flips the phone to point at her wrist — the camera angle changes mid-scene from self-shot to wrist-shot as she performs the flip
- **Camera movement:** The motion of the wrist-flip itself is the camera movement — natural and quick; after the flip, the camera holds on the wrist with slight natural tremor as the bangles settle
- **Framing:** After the flip: wrist and bangles fill the frame naturally; the Alex and Ani wordmark and CTA appear over this image

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Same natural room light as the rest of the piece; from the wrist-flip angle the light may hit the bangles more directly — allow this; let the bangles catch and reflect
- **Quality:** Natural, warm; the bangles may flare slightly as the angle changes — preserve this
- **Mood:** The reveal — she shows you what she picked, the way you would show a friend on video call

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Her wrist with stacked charm bangles — anchor, and others; same woman
- **Action:** The phone flips from self-shot to wrist-shot (this motion is the scene's energy); then holds on the wrist for approximately 2 seconds as text resolves over it
- **Expression:** Wrist only; bangles catching light after the flip completes

### Environment
- **Background:** After flip: natural room background from wrist angle — whatever is behind her wrist in that space; warm and neutral
- **Depth of field:** Phone camera depth at this close distance — bangles sharp, background falls away naturally

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold bangles, warm skin, warm room background
- **Grade:** Same light warm pass; the slight flare from the bangle as light catches it post-flip should be preserved

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Resolves to a final note or ambient silence
- **Text overlay:** Alex and Ani wordmark appears over the wrist image (warm off-white); then: "Every charm has a meaning. Find yours." — serif, warm gold; CTA: "Find Your Charm" — sans-serif, off-white, below

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani anchor, moon, star, and heart charm bangle product photography
- Alex and Ani wordmark in warm gold and off-white
- Creator/UGC lifestyle imagery of charm bangles on diverse skin tones in real environments
- Pandora creator whitelisting format references for direct-to-camera style

## Style References
- Pandora creator whitelisting format — direct-to-camera, conversational, authentic
- TikTok native creator format — phone self-shot, captions as design element, real environments
- UGC (user-generated content) jewelry reviews — the "let me show you this" phone energy
- Emma Chamberlain early YouTube vlog visual aesthetic — warm, imperfect, genuine

## Negative Prompts
- No cool-toned or silver jewelry — all metal must be warm gold
- No white or grey backgrounds — cream, warm neutral, and real-room environments only
- No flat-lay hands with perfect manicures or stock photography poses
- No spiritual cliches: no crystals, incense, tarot cards, or candles
- No artificially generated or obviously synthetic-looking hands or wrists
- No studio lighting, softboxes, or ring lights visible in frame or implied by the quality of light
- No gimbal-smooth camera movement — all movement must feel like a phone held by a human arm
- No overly produced or polished audio quality in the VO — it should sound like a phone mic, not a VO booth
- No over-styled or creative-directed environments — real rooms only
- No cool color grading or heavy desaturation — the grade should feel like a warm phone camera
- No scripted-feeling delivery — the direct address must feel genuinely unscripted

## Post-Production Notes
- Color grade: light and warm — the baseline is a good phone camera in a warm room; warm tones boosted slightly; no heavy push in either direction; the grade confirms authenticity, not production value
- Text overlays: creator-caption style for Scene 3 (appear mid-clip, not strictly on cut); all other text appears on cut
- Serif typeface in warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm names; sans-serif off-white for supporting copy and CTA
- Guitar plucks in Scene 3 must be frame-accurate to each cut
- Captions burned in throughout for sound-off environments — styled as creator captions, not broadcast lower-thirds; clean, legible, minimal
- Scene 5 wrist-flip: the camera motion during the flip can be optionally smoothed slightly in post — but only slightly; the motion itself should remain visible
- The three Scene 3 wrist shots should retain their distinct color environments — do not color-match them to each other; the variety is the authenticity signal
- Music at Scene 4 should be reduced in the mix so her voice is 80% of the audio mix — the VO is the primary audio, music is the support
- No transitions — hard cuts throughout; this is native social format
- Sound design: real room audio and phone mic quality should be preserved or simulated; do not apply professional audio processing that reveals a production environment
