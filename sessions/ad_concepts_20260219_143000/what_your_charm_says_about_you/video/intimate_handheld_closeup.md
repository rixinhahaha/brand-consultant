## Brand Visual Direction
This variation leans into tactile intimacy — the camera never pulls back far enough to feel composed or editorial. Everything feels discovered in the moment, as if a close friend is filming on a lazy Sunday afternoon with warm light pooling through a linen curtain. The palette stays locked in amber cream and warm skin: gold (#ab8c52) against natural flesh tones, champagne linen, and honeyed shadow. The mood is personal journal entry, not advertisement.

## Generation Prompt
> Vertical 9:16 format, shot entirely handheld with slight natural camera drift and micro-shake throughout — never stabilized, always breathing. Opens on an extreme overhead close-up: a single gold anchor charm bangle rests on a cream linen surface, diffused natural window light raking softly across the metal. A woman's hand with natural, unpainted nails and warm brown skin tone reaches into frame from the right, fingers slightly imperfect in their reach, lifting the bangle with genuine care. Cut immediately to a medium eye-level shot — the same woman in a loose linen shirt, layered gold necklaces catching ambient window light, slides the anchor bangle onto her wrist alongside two others already stacked; she glances down with a quiet, private smile that was not performed for camera. The handheld camera drifts slightly into her wrist as she does this, searching and finding the detail. Quick-cut montage of three tight wrist shots — moon charm bangle on a lighter skin tone, star charm stacked above it on a deeper skin tone, a hand holding a heart charm up toward a window on a medium warm skin tone — each cut synced to a single guitar pluck, the camera never fully settled on any of them, always arriving mid-motion. Back to the original woman, handheld push-in landing on her wrist as bangles catch the light in a micro-flare; she speaks directly into camera with unhurried confidence, the lens close enough to read the texture of her linen sleeve. Final scene: a slow handheld drift across three gold charm bangles arranged loosely on cream fabric — not staged, slightly overlapping — as the Alex and Ani wordmark resolves into frame. Color grade throughout: warm amber push, slightly desaturated midtones, highlights pulled toward golden-amber, shadows lifted to a soft champagne. Music: fingerpicked acoustic guitar, sparse and unhurried, with single plucks synced to each montage cut.

- **Subject:** Gold anchor charm bangle on cream linen surface; woman's hand with natural unpainted nails and warm skin tone
- **Action:** Hand reaches in from right and lifts the bangle slowly, fingers wrapping around it with familiar ease
- **Expression:** No face in frame — all emotion read through the deliberateness of the hand

### Environment
- **Background:** Cream linen fabric surface, slightly wrinkled — not pressed or styled
- **Depth of field:** Very shallow, f/1.8 equivalent — bangle in sharp focus, linen texture softly rendered, background falls to soft cream

## Scene 2 — The Slide (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up
- **Camera angle:** Eye level

- **Framing:** Woman center-frame from chest to mid-forearm; wrist action occupies lower-center third; face visible in soft upper frame

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Natural window light from camera-right, slightly behind subject — creating a rim of warm light on her forearm
- **Quality:** Soft directional; warm, approximately 4600K; subtle fill from a cream reflector or bounce card left
- **Mood:** Warm, personal — the light of a real room, not a set

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman, late 20s, loose linen shirt, layered gold necklaces, warm skin tone
- **Action:** Slides anchor bangle onto wrist alongside two pre-existing bangles; glances down at her wrist with a small private smile
- **Expression:** Quiet satisfaction — the smile belongs to a private thought, not a camera

### Environment
- **Background:** Soft-focus interior — cream or warm linen wall, indistinct; a hint of warm afternoon light
- **Depth of field:** Shallow, f/2.0 equivalent — wrist and bangles sharpest; face slightly softer; background fully separated

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm gold bangles, cream linen shirt, warm skin tone, champagne background

## Scene 3 — Charm Montage (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Extreme close-up (each cut)
- **Camera angle:** Slight low angle on wrist shots — camera tilted 10–15 degrees below wrist level, looking up at charms
- **Camera movement:** Each cut arrives mid-motion — handheld landing on subject already moving, never pre-composed; (a) drift left across moon charm, (b) arrive on star charm already stacking, (c) hand already rising with heart charm toward window
- **Framing:** Wrist and charm fill 60% of frame in each shot; skin tone and bangle texture dominant

### Lighting
- **Key light:** (a) Window light, soft overhead; (b) Same window, slightly more directional; (c) Backlit — heart charm held toward window, light passing through and around charm
- **Quality:** Varying slightly cut to cut — intentionally inconsistent in the way real environments are; all warm, 4500–5000K
- **Mood:** Kinetic and personal — each shot feels caught, not composed

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Three different wrists and skin tones — (a) lighter skin tone with moon charm bangle, (b) deeper brown skin tone with star charm stacking on top of moon, (c) medium warm skin tone, hand lifting heart charm toward light
- **Action:** (a) Moon bangle settles on wrist; (b) Star bangle slides over hand; (c) Fingers lift heart charm into backlight
- **Expression:** Hands only — no faces; emotion carried through skin texture and gesture

### Environment
- **Background:** (a) and (b) soft cream interior; (c) blown-out warm window light behind charm
- **Depth of field:** Extremely shallow across all three — f/1.4 equivalent; charms razor-sharp, bangles behind slightly soft

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold charms, varied warm skin tones, cream and warm-white ambient
- **Grade:** Same warm grade; (c) backlit shot allows a slight golden flare at highlight edge of charm — preserve this

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Guitar pluck synced precisely to each of the three cuts — three notes, evenly spaced
- **Text overlay:** Appears on each cut simultaneously with guitar pluck: (a) "Moon. Intuition." (b) "Star. Courage." (c) "Heart. Love you give freely." — clean serif, warm gold, centered lower-third

## Scene 4 — Direct Address (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up
- **Camera angle:** Eye level — camera at exact eye height, lens close enough to read micro-expression
- **Camera movement:** Handheld — very slow, almost imperceptible push-in over 4 seconds; camera breathing with subject
- **Framing:** Woman fills center frame, wrist with bangles visible in lower-left; face occupies upper two-thirds

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Natural window light from camera-left — soft, slightly frontal, falling across her face with a gentle shadow on the right cheek
- **Quality:** Soft, flattering; warm 4700K; no artificial fill — let the shadow side fall naturally
- **Mood:** Confessional, direct — the light of a conversation, not a commercial

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Same woman from Scene 1 and 2; wrist with stacked bangles visible below
- **Action:** Speaks directly to camera, wrist rising slightly into frame as she speaks; bangles catch a light flare
- **Expression:** Quiet certainty — not performative confidence, but the settled kind

### Environment
- **Background:** Soft cream interior, window light edge visible; warm and slightly out of focus
- **Depth of field:** Shallow, f/2.0 equivalent — face in focus, background fully separated, bangles on wrist slightly softer than face

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm skin, cream linen, gold bangles catching amber light
- **Grade:** Same warm grade; slight vignette at frame edge to draw eye to center

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** Same woman's voice (sync to lip movement): "I didn't pick this one because it's pretty. I picked it because it's mine."
- **Music:** Guitar continues — a second fingerpicked note or two; tempo remains sparse
- **Text overlay:** None (direct address carries the scene; no competing text)

## Scene 5 — Product Resolution (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up
- **Camera angle:** Overhead, slight tilt (10 degrees off true vertical)
- **Camera movement:** Handheld slow drift right across the bangles — not a deliberate pan, a natural drift
- **Framing:** Three to four bangles loosely overlapping on cream linen; Alex and Ani wordmark resolves in lower-center as drift settles

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Same natural window light from camera-left, soft overhead rake across the metal surfaces
- **Quality:** Soft; warm; light catches charm details on the bangles as the drift moves across them
- **Mood:** Still, resolved — the warmth of a decision already made

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Three to four gold charm bangles on cream linen — loosely placed, naturally overlapping, not styled into a flat-lay
- **Action:** Camera drifts slowly across the grouping; Alex and Ani wordmark fades (dissolves slowly) into lower center of frame
- **Expression:** Product presentation — charm details visible, metal quality evident in the light catch

### Environment
- **Background:** Cream linen — same surface texture as Scene 1; continuity of environment
- **Depth of field:** Moderate, f/2.8 equivalent — nearest bangle sharpest, furthest bangle softening slightly

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold (#ab8c52), cream, champagne
- **Grade:** Same warm grade; wordmark in warm off-white or cream — not stark white

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Guitar resolves to a final held note or gentle chord — quiet, warm
- **Text overlay:** "Every charm has a meaning. Find yours." — clean serif, warm gold; then CTA: "Find Your Charm" — sans-serif, off-white, below wordmark

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani anchor charm bangle product photography (warm background versions)
- Alex and Ani moon, star, and heart charm bangle product shots
- Brand lifestyle imagery featuring stacked bangles on diverse skin tones
- Alex and Ani wordmark in warm gold and off-white versions

## Style References
- Gorjana "Wear Your Intention" minimal editorial visual language — adapted for motion
- Petra Collins personal/intimate photography aesthetic — handheld warmth, imperfect framing
- Kinfolk magazine lifestyle photography — natural environments, unhurried moments
- Pandora creator whitelisting format — direct-to-camera authenticity

## Negative Prompts
- No cool-toned or silver jewelry — all metal must be warm gold
- No white or grey backgrounds — cream, linen, and warm skin tones only
- No flat-lay hands with perfect manicures or stock photography hand poses
- No spiritual cliches: no crystals, incense, tarot cards, or candles
- No artificially generated or obviously synthetic-looking hands or wrists
- No gimbal-smoothed or stabilized camera movement — all motion must feel handheld and human
- No studio lighting setups — no softboxes, ring lights, or artificial key sources visible in frame
- No over-styled product arrangements — bangles should feel placed, not designed
- No fast-cut editing that breaks the intimate pacing

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm color grade throughout — pull highlights toward golden-amber (#ab8c52 range); slightly desaturate midtones; lift shadows to a soft champagne base
- Text overlays appear on cut — no fade-in animations; text is immediate and clean
- Serif typeface in warm gold (#ab8c52) for charm names ("Moon. Intuition." etc.)
- Sans-serif in off-white for supporting copy and CTA
- Guitar plucks in Scene 3 must be precisely frame-accurate to each cut — sync in post if needed
- Captions burned in for sound-off viewing — placed lower-third, never obscuring wrist or charm detail
- Handheld camera motion should not be additionally stabilized in post — preserve the natural drift
- Transition between Scene 2 and Scene 3: hard cut on the beat
- Transition between Scene 3 and Scene 4: hard cut, no transition
- Final scene wordmark: slow dissolve in over 1 second, not a hard cut appearance
- No color grading that pushes toward cool tones at any point in the grade
