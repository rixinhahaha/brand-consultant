Primary color reference is warm gold (#ab8c52); avoid cool silvers, stark whites, or clinical lighting. Music should lean acoustic-ambient or soft indie-folk for emotional content; upbeat synth-pop for collab/nostalgia content. Typography should pair a clean serif (for symbol names or headlines) with a minimal sans-serif for body copy. Every shot should include at least one wrist or hand model wearing multiple bangles — stacking is non-negotiable as a visual cue. Never shoot product on plain white backgrounds in paid social contexts. Always include on-screen text captions for sound-off environments.",

      "post_production_notes": "The motion graphic in Scene 1 is the most technically demanding element — brief a motion designer with the following spec: car enters at 2x normal scroll speed, engine sound perfectly synced, the red streak should be drawn in a single fluid motion (not fade), and the transformation to bangle should be a simple, satisfying morph (1 second, ease-in-out). The streak color should graduate from Hot Wheels red (#e31837) to A&A gold (#ab8c52) during the morph — this is the brand handshake moment. Audio: Hot Wheels engine SFX should cut cleanly at the end of Scene 1; no audio bleeds into Scene 2 except the VO. Color grade: warmer and slightly more saturated than standard A&A content to match the playful energy of the collab. CTA button in Scene 4 must use Hot Wheels red per collab branding guidelines — confirm with brand partnership legal team."

      "production_notes": "Cast: one wrist model — consistent throughout the entire video. Warm skin tone preferred (reads best in warm-lit gold context). The wrist must be bare at the start — no other jewelry, no watch. Bangles selected should represent a range of the core line: Path of Life, Moon Phase, Anchor, Shooting Star, Strength of Heart, Wrap Bangle, Zodiac or Initial. Each bangle should be gold finish. The lighting setup must remain exactly consistent across all cuts — this should ideally be shot in a single session with very controlled light so the color temperature does not shift between months. If this is produced as creator UGC, brief the creator to maintain consistent lighting throughout. Music: original piano composition or licensed acoustic piano loop, building structure from minimal to full over the duration of the video.",
      "reference": "Pura Vida's Bracelet Club subscription unboxing reels — the recurring content engine and FOMO loop. Adapted: A&A's version replaces the subscription model with a self-directed collecting journey, and replaces the unboxing reveal format with a longitudinal time-lapse of one person's actual collection building. The 'year' framing is unique to A&A. Pandora's sequential retargeting creative — awareness through brand narrative — also informs the choice of this as a top-of-funnel awareness vehicle.",

      ],
      "post_production_notes": "The month text overlays must be precisely timed to land on the exact frame where the bangle first makes wrist contact — not before, not after. This sync point is the rhythm of the entire video. In post, identify each bangle-contact frame and place the month text there. Color grade: warm and consistent across all cuts — this is critical because lighting inconsistency between 'months' will read as poor production. Grade all cuts to the same warm-gold reference frame before final output. Music mix: the building piano structure should be mixed so the 'full chord' in Scene 5 feels genuinely resolved and satisfying — this is an emotional payoff moment. The ASMR bangle sounds should be subtly present throughout Scenes 1-4, then absent in Scene 5 (only music) to create a sense of completion. Final text 'A year. Seven charms. One wrist.' should appear in three separate beats — not all at once — one line per 0.8 seconds, synced to the held final chord."
