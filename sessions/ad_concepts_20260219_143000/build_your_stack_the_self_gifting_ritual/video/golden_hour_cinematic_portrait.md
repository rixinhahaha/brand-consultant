## Brand Visual Direction
This variation elevates the self-gifting ritual into a cinematic portrait — warm, unhurried, and bathed in the specific amber gold of late-afternoon light. The brand's primary gold (#ab8c52) is not just product color here; it is the light itself. Every surface — skin, linen, wall — takes on the same tonal family as the bangles, creating a world where the jewelry belongs completely. This is the most visually polished variation, shot with gimbal precision and deliberate composition, evoking the emotional warmth of a memory already becoming precious.

## Generation Prompt
> A vertical 9:16 cinematic portrait video shot on a fluid gimbal with deliberate, unhurried camera movements — slow push-ins, smooth arcs, and controlled drift. The entire piece is bathed in rich golden hour light: a practical light source positioned low and camera-right at roughly 15–20 degrees above horizontal, casting long warm shadows and flooding all surfaces with amber-gold at approximately 3200K–3500K. A woman in her early 30s with a composed, inward presence sits near a sun-drenched window in a genuinely lived-in interior; she wears a simple cream or linen-toned top that merges with the warm environment. The video opens with a slow gimbal push-in toward the table where five Alex and Ani bangles are laid in a loose line, the low light catching each one with a long soft highlight. Large white serif text appears on a briefly dimmed frame — "Nobody bought these for me." — holds, then dissolves to "I did." The camera tracks with cinematic grace to a close-up of her wrist as she slides on the first gold bangle; the golden light creates a warm specular along the metal's edge without overexposing. Her voice enters — calm, first-person — as she adds each bangle, the camera executing a slow horizontal arc around her wrist to reveal the growing stack from multiple angles. In Scene 4 she looks directly into the lens, her face half in golden light and half in warm shadow, her stacked wrist held beside her face in a composed portrait frame. The final scene cuts to a near-overhead product shot on warm linen, a barely perceptible Ken Burns push-in completing the piece. The grade throughout is warm, rich, and slightly film-like — lifted shadows, a strong amber-gold push in midtones, subtle halation around highlights, and a faint organic grain.

## Scene 1 — The Arrangement (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium shot opening; slow push-in to medium close-up
- **Camera angle:** Slightly above eye level — looking down at a gentle angle to show bangles on table and her face beyond
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal slow push-in — smooth, continuous, covering approximately 20% of focal length over 4 seconds
- **Framing:** Bangles arranged in a loose diagonal in the lower third; her face and upper body occupy the upper two-thirds; strong rule-of-thirds placement; warm window light bleeds in from the right edge

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Practical golden hour window light — low, warm, raking from camera-right at approximately 20 degrees above horizontal
- **Quality:** Directional and warm; 3200K–3500K; creates long soft shadows from bangles across table surface; skin takes on amber warmth
- **Mood:** The light communicates late-afternoon reflection — a moment that has weight because the day is nearing its end

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman, early 30s, composed and still; wearing cream or warm linen top
- **Action:** Sits looking at the laid-out bangles with quiet deliberateness; picks one up near the end of the scene
- **Expression:** Thoughtful, inward, at peace — not searching, deciding

### Environment
- **Background:** Interior with warm-lit wall; texture of plaster or aged paint visible; a few soft-focus background elements suggest habitation (a plant, a shelf) without staging
- **Depth of field:** Shallow-moderate — f/2.0 equivalent; bangles and her face share depth plane; background falls softly

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Deep amber, warm gold, cream, rich skin tones in golden light
- **Grade:** Strong amber-gold push in midtones; shadows lifted and warm-tinted (never cool); highlights with slight halation to emulate film stock behavior

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** None — ambient room tone with a hint of natural golden hour stillness (distant birdsong or street sounds faintly)
- **Text overlay:** Large centered white serif — "Nobody bought these for me." — on a briefly darkened frame (vignette at approximately 60% exposure, warm not cold); dissolves to "I did." after 2 seconds

## Scene 2 — Light on Metal (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Extreme close-up on wrist; widens fractionally as she raises it
- **Camera angle:** Wrist level; camera nearly parallel to the table, tilted very slightly upward
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal slow upward tilt-follow as she raises her wrist; smooth and continuous
- **Framing:** Bangle and wrist fill the vertical center; golden light enters from the right edge of frame as a warm flare-adjacent softness; her raised arm creates a leading line

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Low golden hour source now raking directly across the bangle surface — creates a long, warm highlight along the metal curve
- **Quality:** Specular but soft — the highlight has gentle falloff rather than a hard catch; approximately 3200K
- **Mood:** The light glorifies the object without being commercial — this is reverence, not advertisement

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Her wrist and forearm; the Path of Life bangle
- **Action:** Slides first bangle on; raises wrist slowly to examine it in the light; reaches for the Strength of Heart bangle
- **Expression:** Wrist-focused; the raised-wrist gesture is naturally graceful in this light

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm amber interior blur; window light creates a soft, luminous background glow behind her arm
- **Depth of field:** Extremely shallow — f/1.4 equivalent; only the bangle face in critical focus; wrist falls softly

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold bangle (#ab8c52) against warm amber light; skin in golden tone; background in luminous cream-amber
- **Grade:** The gold of the bangle and the gold of the light become one visual note — this convergence is the grade's primary goal

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "I started with one. For a really hard year I got through."
- **Music:** None yet — VO and ambient golden hour room tone
- **Text overlay:** Real-time VO caption in minimal sans-serif, lower third: "I started with one. For a really hard year I got through."

## Scene 3 — The Arc (5s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up to tight close-up with lateral camera arc
- **Camera angle:** Wrist level; gimbal executes a slow 30-degree arc around the raised wrist from left to right
- **Camera movement:** Fluid gimbal arc — the camera orbits the wrist slowly, revealing all three bangles from different angles as it moves
- **Framing:** Wrist centered throughout the arc; the orbiting motion means the background transitions from warm window light to warm wall shadow, adding visual depth

### Lighting
- **Key light:** The golden hour source catches each bangle at a different angle during the arc — each bangle's highlight shifts and glows in sequence as the camera moves around
- **Quality:** The arc creates a kinetic light play — not flashy, but quietly spectacular; the metal is alive
- **Mood:** The orbiting motion suggests the stack is worth examining from every angle — worth knowing deeply

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Her wrist with three bangles — Path of Life, Strength of Heart, Moon Phase
- **Action:** Slides on Moon Phase bangle; holds wrist up; slowly rotates as the camera arcs
- **Expression:** Her face is partially visible in background; she watches the bangles in the light with quiet satisfaction

### Environment
- **Background:** Transitions during arc — from bright warm window glow to rich amber wall shadow; creates natural bokeh depth change
- **Depth of field:** Shallow — f/1.8 equivalent; bangles remain in focus throughout arc; background shifts with camera position

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Three gold tones in motion; warm skin; shifting background from luminous to amber-shadow
- **Grade:** The arc's shifting light means midtone warmth peaks and dips slightly — this natural variation is preserved, not corrected out

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "Then one when I finally knew what I wanted. And one just because the moon always makes me feel less alone."
- **Music:** None yet — VO and ambient
- **Text overlay:** Real-time VO caption, lower third sans-serif: "Then one when I finally knew what I wanted. / And one just because the moon always makes me feel less alone."

## Scene 4 — Portrait in Gold (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Cinematic portrait — medium close-up, face and raised wrist
- **Camera angle:** Eye level; straight on
- **Camera movement:** Gimbal hold with an imperceptibly slow push-in — barely 5% of focal length over 4 seconds; the effect is subliminal
- **Framing:** Her face occupies the upper two-thirds; the stacked wrist is raised and held beside her face on the right third; she is split-lit by golden hour — warm key on the left side of her face, warm shadow on the right

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Golden hour source from camera-right, now lighting her face; creates a classic Rembrandt-adjacent split — warm gold on the lit half, deep amber shadow on the other
- **Quality:** Directional, warm, no fill — the shadow side retains warmth from environmental bounce off the amber wall
- **Mood:** This is the most emotionally potent lighting moment — she looks like someone in a painting made on an important afternoon

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman's face and stacked wrist together
- **Action:** She looks directly into the camera — sustained, unperformed, without a smile forced; the gaze is simply present and honest; music begins to lift
- **Expression:** Quiet, grounded, a trace of earned pride; the kind of expression that follows "I did that"

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm amber interior in soft focus; window light bleeds at the edge of frame as a soft warm glow
- **Depth of field:** Moderate — f/2.8 equivalent; both face and wrist in focus; background softly separated

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Deep amber on face; warm gold on wrist; luminous background softness
- **Grade:** This is the peak moment of the film's color arc — the warmest, richest frame; midtones fully golden; slight halation on highlights; the grade mirrors the emotional lift

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "This stack is basically my autobiography. And I'm still writing it."
- **Music:** Soft acoustic-ambient or single-instrument indie-folk enters — warm guitar or piano, no percussion, at low-mid volume; slight emotional swell
- **Text overlay:** Real-time caption: "This stack is basically my autobiography. / And I'm still writing it."

## Scene 5 — The Still Life (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Near-overhead product close-up
- **Camera angle:** 80-degree overhead — almost directly above but with a slight perspective angle to retain the warmth of the linen surface texture
- **Camera movement:** Very slight Ken Burns push-in — 3–4% scale increase over 3 seconds; imperceptible in motion, noticeable only on freeze-frame
- **Framing:** Three bangles arranged in a loose natural grouping on warm linen; Alex and Ani logo lower center; text elements placed with generous negative space in the upper and lower thirds

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Soft warm overhead diffusion — simulates late-afternoon skylight through a diffusion panel; approximately 3800K; no hard shadows; slight warmth from a side bounce source
- **Quality:** Even and gentle; bangles read with full detail; linen texture catches low-side light for tactile warmth
- **Mood:** The stillness after emotion — this shot is a quiet breath; the light is the same world the preceding scenes lived in

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Path of Life, Strength of Heart, Moon Phase bangles
- **Action:** Static arrangement with Ken Burns push; text elements appear sequentially
- **Expression:** Product presentation — loosely arranged, not symmetrically styled; feels placed, not composed

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm linen — sand-cream tone; visible fabric texture adds warmth and tactility
- **Depth of field:** Moderate-deep — f/5.6 equivalent; all bangles in focus; linen texture sharp; frame edge falls off softly

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold bangles, warm linen, off-white text
- **Grade:** Consistent warm grade from preceding scenes; final shot is the calmest frame — the emotional arc lands in stillness

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Acoustic-ambient continues; barely perceptible swell as logo appears; resolves quietly
- **Text overlay:** Alex and Ani logo fades in first (center); "From $28." in clean serif below; "Build your stack. One chapter at a time." headline serif above; "Shop Bangles" CTA in sans-serif at bottom — sequential fade-ins over 3 seconds

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani Path of Life bangle product photography (warm-background versions)
- Alex and Ani Strength of Heart bangle product photography
- Alex and Ani Moon Phase bangle product photography
- Brand logo lockup (light/cream version for warm backgrounds)
- Alex and Ani lifestyle photography featuring golden hour or warm afternoon light

## Style References
- Gorjana wrist close-up visual language — directional warm light on metal-skin compositions
- Portrait photography in the style of Gregory Crewdson (intimacy and compositional weight, without the darkness)
- Terrence Malick golden hour cinematography — low sun, raking light, reverence for natural illumination
- Armani Beauty and Chanel fragrance advertising — cinematic portraiture, emotional restraint, luxury through light quality

## Negative Prompts
- Do not cast a woman who reads as a lifestyle influencer — overly curated apartment, ring light glow, or sponsored-content cadence will destroy credibility
- Avoid showing gift boxes, gift bags, or wrapping — this must read as a self-purchase moment
- Do not use upbeat, trendy pop music — the emotional tone is reflective and personal
- Avoid showing more than 6 bangles on the wrist at once — keep it curated
- No AI-generated room environments — setting must feel genuinely lived-in
- No cool-toned lighting at any point — this variation lives entirely in warm amber-gold; any blue, silver, or daylight-white tones must be excluded
- Avoid fast cuts, whip pans, or any energetic editing — every transition must be a slow dissolve or deliberate straight cut
- No ring light catchlights — practical golden hour and warm ambient only
- Avoid over-styled product arrangements — the still life must feel placed, not art-directed
- No lens flares added in post — if flares exist they must be organic from the practical light source

## Post-Production Notes
- Grade is the dominant creative tool in this variation — the amber-gold temperature should be consistent and intentional end-to-end; use LUT or manual grade to push midtones toward #ab8c52 family without destroying skin detail
- "Nobody bought these for me. I did." graphic treatment: large white serif on a briefly darkened frame with warm (not cool) vignette; the darkening should retain the amber quality of the overall grade
- All VO captions in real-time, lower third, minimal sans-serif — phrase-by-phrase in sync with speech
- Transitions: straight cuts between scenes 1–4; very slow dissolve (12–18 frames) into final product shot
- Final product shot: very slight Ken Burns push-in — subtle over 3 seconds
- Music: acoustic-ambient or warm single-instrument indie-folk; enters in Scene 4 at low volume; swell on product shot; no percussion; resolve quietly rather than cut off
- Slight halation effect on highlights across all scenes — emulates the look of fast film stock in bright conditions; reinforces golden hour quality without adding artificial glow effects
- Color grading pass should be done with a warm primary LUT and then refined scene-by-scene to account for varying light quality between scenes
- Grain: add fine organic grain (approximately 10–15%) to unify scenes and push away from digital sharpness
