## Brand Visual Direction
This variation leans fully into raw, unmediated intimacy — the visual language of a private moment accidentally witnessed. The warm gold of Alex and Ani's signature (#ab8c52) appears against olive-toned skin and amber-washed interiors, never polished, always personal. Color stays in a muted amber-cream register with lifted shadows that feel like morning light through curtains rather than a set. The camera breathes with the subject — slight organic drift, micro-corrections, human imperfection encoded in every frame.

## Generation Prompt
> A vertical 9:16 video shot entirely handheld with a slight natural drift and organic breathing motion, as if filmed by the subject herself or a close friend. The setting is a genuinely lived-in apartment interior — a small wooden table, soft morning light spilling from a window off-camera left, warm amber shadows filling the room. A woman in her early 30s with a natural, unadorned presence sits at the table; she wears a soft neutral top. The video opens in near-silence with ambient room tone — faint street sounds, a creak — as her bare wrist enters the bottom of frame. She lays out five Alex and Ani bangles with quiet deliberateness. Large white serif text appears centered on a briefly held dark vignette: "Nobody bought these for me." A beat. It changes: "I did." The camera drifts gently to a close-up of her wrist as she slides the first gold-toned Path of Life bangle on; the metal catches the ambient window light with a soft, non-specular warmth. Her voice — relaxed, first-person, unhurried — enters as natural VO. She adds a second bangle, then a third, turning her wrist slowly so the bangles catch the light together. She then looks directly into the lens — not posed, just honest — her stacked wrist held beside her face. The handheld camera holds this moment with a slight settle. The edit cuts to a product close-up on warm linen, the Alex and Ani logo and pricing appearing as clean serif text. Throughout, on-screen captions track her voiceover in real-time in a minimal sans-serif. The grade is warm and slightly underexposed — lifted shadows, a faint amber cast, no crushed blacks — evoking golden hour memory rather than studio precision.

## Scene 1 — The Decision (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up with drift into close-up
- **Camera angle:** Slight low angle, just below eye level — grounds the subject without pedestaling
- **Camera movement:** Handheld with natural micro-drift; no stabilization, organic breathing motion
- **Framing:** Subject left-of-center on rule of thirds; bangles spread on table occupy lower-right quadrant; negative space above her head breathes

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Practical window light, camera left, angled roughly 45 degrees across the table surface
- **Quality:** Soft, diffused through sheer fabric or thin curtain — 4500K to 5000K daylight, slightly amber-shifted in grade
- **Mood:** Quiet and contemplative; the light feels accidental, like it always looks this way in the morning

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman, early 30s, natural makeup or none, wearing a simple neutral-toned top
- **Action:** Sits at small table with bangles laid out; looks at them thoughtfully; picks one up with deliberate slowness
- **Expression:** Pensive, inward — the expression of someone making a meaningful choice privately

### Environment
- **Background:** Lived-in apartment interior — soft-focus suggestion of shelving, plants, or a wall with texture; nothing curated or staged
- **Depth of field:** Shallow, approximately f/1.8 equivalent; background fully separated

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm amber, cream, muted olive skin tones, gold metal
- **Grade:** Slightly underexposed overall; lifted shadows to maintain warmth; gentle orange-amber push in midtones; no crushed blacks

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None in this scene
- **Music:** None — ambient room tone only (faint street, air, presence)
- **Text overlay:** Large centered white serif — "Nobody bought these for me." — holds 1.5s, then dissolves and changes to "I did." — holds 1.5s on a briefly darkened frame (vignette dims to approximately 60% exposure)

## Scene 2 — The First Chapter (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Extreme close-up on wrist and bangle; pulls back marginally to tight close-up
- **Camera angle:** Eye level to the wrist — camera parallel to the table surface
- **Camera movement:** Handheld, slow natural drift upward as she raises her wrist; slight tilt follow
- **Framing:** Wrist and bangle fill 60% of frame; her forearm traces a diagonal; warm background bleeds into upper frame

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Same practical window; now raking across the wrist from left, creating soft-edged shadow that gives the bangle dimension
- **Quality:** Soft directional; the gold of the bangle catches one highlight point — not specular, just warm
- **Mood:** The light dignifies the moment — the bangle feels significant

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Her wrist and hand; forearm partially in frame
- **Action:** Slides Path of Life bangle onto wrist; raises wrist to look at it; reaches for a second bangle (Strength of Heart)
- **Expression:** Not visible — focus is entirely on the wrist and metal

### Environment
- **Background:** Blurred warm interior — amber and cream tones; table edge in soft foreground
- **Depth of field:** Very shallow, f/1.4 equivalent; only the bangle and a short section of wrist in critical focus

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold (#ab8c52), warm skin tone, amber background, cream foreground blur
- **Grade:** Warm midtones; bangle gold is the visual anchor — grade preserves metal warmth without overexposing highlights

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "I started with one. For a really hard year I got through." — delivered quietly, first-person, no performance
- **Music:** None — VO only against ambient room tone
- **Text overlay:** Real-time caption in minimal sans-serif, lower third placement: "I started with one. For a really hard year I got through."

## Scene 3 — The Stack Grows (5s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Close-up on wrist; camera follows the slow rotation of her wrist
- **Camera angle:** Slightly above wrist level — allows viewer to see bangle faces as she rotates
- **Camera movement:** Handheld with intentional slow track following wrist rotation; one micro-reframe mid-scene
- **Framing:** Three bangles together fill the center frame; her fingers visible at edges; background entirely blurred

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Window light now grazes across all three bangles simultaneously; each catches light at slightly different angles during rotation
- **Quality:** Soft and warm; the rotation creates a gentle play of light across the metal faces
- **Mood:** The light reveals meaning through movement — each bangle becomes distinct

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Her wrist with three bangles — Path of Life, Strength of Heart, Moon Phase
- **Action:** Slides on the third bangle (Moon Phase); looks at all three; rotates wrist slowly; holds the rotation
- **Expression:** Wrist only; the action is contemplative and self-directed

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm amber interior blur; edge of table visible as soft-focus horizontal line
- **Depth of field:** Extremely shallow — f/1.2 equivalent; only the bangle faces in focus during rotation

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Three gold tones together — slight variation in finish between bangles adds visual texture; warm skin against metal
- **Grade:** Midtone warmth increased slightly; subtle grain added to reinforce analog, personal quality

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "Then one when I finally knew what I wanted. And one just because the moon always makes me feel less alone."
- **Music:** None — VO only; room tone continues
- **Text overlay:** Real-time caption, same sans-serif lower third: "Then one when I finally knew what I wanted. / And one just because the moon always makes me feel less alone."

## Scene 4 — Direct Address (4s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up — face and wrist together in frame
- **Camera angle:** Eye level; direct
- **Camera movement:** Handheld hold with very slight natural settle — the kind of stillness that takes effort
- **Framing:** Her face left-of-center; stacked wrist held up beside her face on the right side of frame; both in focus; her eyes meet the lens directly

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Window light now on her face — soft, slightly raking from left; catchlights visible in both eyes
- **Quality:** Soft, warm, natural — 4700K with amber grade pull; no fill, slight natural shadow on right side of face
- **Mood:** Honest and unguarded; the slight shadow makes this feel like a private admission, not a performance

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Woman's face and her stacked wrist raised beside it
- **Action:** She looks directly into the camera — sustained, natural, unhurried. Holds the gaze. A small natural smile or neutral resolve at the end.
- **Expression:** Direct, grounded, a trace of quiet pride — not performative

### Environment
- **Background:** Soft-focus apartment interior; warm amber and cream
- **Depth of field:** Moderate — f/2.8 equivalent; both face and wrist remain in focus; background falls away

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Warm skin tones, gold bangles, cream and amber background
- **Grade:** Music lifts slightly here — grade follows: shadows lift a touch, midtone warmth increases; the frame opens emotionally

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** "This stack is basically my autobiography. And I'm still writing it."
- **Music:** Acoustic-ambient or soft indie-folk guitar enters very softly — single instrument, no percussion, under the VO
- **Text overlay:** Real-time caption: "This stack is basically my autobiography. / And I'm still writing it."

## Scene 5 — Product Close-Up (3s)

### Shot & Camera
- **Shot type:** Tight product close-up; very slight Ken Burns push-in over the duration
- **Camera angle:** Overhead or near-overhead — bangles laid flat on linen surface
- **Camera movement:** Imperceptible slow push-in (Ken Burns effect); no handheld drift — this is the one stabilized moment
- **Framing:** Three bangles arranged loosely on warm linen, slightly off-center; Alex and Ani logo in lower third; text elements placed with generous negative space

### Lighting
- **Key light:** Soft diffused overhead — simulates natural north light; no harsh shadows; warm fill from sides
- **Quality:** Flat-soft, warm; 4000K; bangles read clearly without overexposed highlights
- **Mood:** Clean and inviting while remaining warm — the transition from emotional to transactional is bridged by consistent color temperature

### Subject & Action
- **Subject:** Path of Life, Strength of Heart, Moon Phase bangles on warm linen
- **Action:** Static product display with slow push-in; text elements appear sequentially
- **Expression:** Product presentation — slightly loose, not overly styled

### Environment
- **Background:** Warm linen texture surface; no white, no cool tones
- **Depth of field:** Moderate — f/4 equivalent; linen texture visible but bangles are primary focus

### Color & Grade
- **Palette:** Gold bangles (#ab8c52 tones), warm linen (cream-sand), off-white text
- **Grade:** Consistent with preceding scenes; warm midtones; clean but not clinical

### Text & Audio
- **Voiceover:** None
- **Music:** Acoustic-ambient continues; very slight swell as product shot holds
- **Text overlay:** Alex and Ani logo (center or lower third); "From $28." in clean serif; "Build your stack. One chapter at a time." in headline serif; "Shop Bangles" CTA in sans-serif — all appear sequentially with subtle fade-ins

## Reference Assets
- Alex and Ani Path of Life bangle product photography (warm-background versions)
- Alex and Ani Strength of Heart bangle product photography
- Alex and Ani Moon Phase bangle product photography
- Brand logo lockup (light/cream version for warm backgrounds)
- Alex and Ani wrist stack lifestyle photography — skin-against-metal close-ups

## Style References
- Gorjana wrist close-up visual language — tight metal-on-skin shots with directional warm light
- Pura Vida personal ambassador UGC reels — first-person bracelet origin story, authentic setting, handheld warmth
- Portrait photography in the style of Petra Collins — muted, intimate, slightly underexposed, deeply personal
- Early-morning window light photography — soft directional naturalism, no artificial augmentation

## Negative Prompts
- Do not cast a woman who reads as a lifestyle influencer — overly curated apartment, ring light glow, or sponsored-content cadence will destroy credibility
- Avoid showing gift boxes, gift bags, or wrapping — this must read as a self-purchase moment
- Do not use upbeat, trendy pop music — the emotional tone is reflective and personal
- Avoid showing more than 6 bangles on the wrist at once — keep it curated
- No AI-generated room environments — setting must feel genuinely lived-in
- No gimbal-smooth movement — this variation must retain handheld organic imperfection throughout
- No ring light or beauty-dish catchlights — practical and window light only
- Avoid any moment that reads as "content creation" — no visible phone, no selfie posture
- No fast cuts or jump cuts of any kind in this variation
- Avoid overly symmetrical or styled flat-lay compositions — product scene should feel loosely arranged

## Post-Production Notes
- Warm, slightly underexposed grade throughout — lifted shadows, gentle amber push in midtones, no crushed blacks
- "Nobody bought these for me. I did." is the single bold graphic moment — large centered white serif on a briefly darkened vignette (dims to approximately 60% exposure); this is the only moment the frame goes dark
- All other text overlays: real-time VO captions in minimal sans-serif, lower third, appearing word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase in sync with speech
- Transitions: straight cuts only between scenes 1–4; very slow dissolve (8–12 frames) into final product shot
- Final product shot: very slight Ken Burns push-in — barely perceptible over 3 seconds
- Music edit: acoustic-ambient or soft single-instrument indie-folk; enters under Scene 4 VO at very low level; slight swell on product shot; no percussion, no drop
- Sound design: ambient room tone preserved throughout scenes 1–3 — do not silence the room; the presence of real space is essential to credibility
- No color grading passes that introduce cool tones at any point — maintain warm amber-cream register end to end
- Grain: add subtle analog grain (light — approximately 15–20% at 1080p equivalent) to reinforce the personal, non-commercial quality of this variation
